## Introduction

First of all, there are a lot of words here. I spent a lot of time making sure they thoroughly yet succinctly (as possible) describe my process and what you should expect when working with me. Please read them. It will help us understand each other much better as we work together!

Secondly, why have this page? You might be wondering, "Shouldn't you just make a contract for each of your clients?" This is a valid point and sometimes necessary and a good idea. However, I like to work with people I get to know and can trust with a "handshake deal." If you have been burned before or are just more comfortable with a written contract, I'd be happy to accommodate you. However, whether we do that or not, here is how I like to work:

## The Process

1. You tell me what you want to have completed.
2. I'll tell you how much I think it will cost me to make that for you. Most of the time, this boils down to how many hours I think I'll need to spend on something to actually solve the problem at hand.
3. After I give you an estimate, I like to hear back if this was vastly different than your expectation. If so, there's probably a disconnect on what I understand that you need and we should probably chat about the requirements. If we agree on the requirements, then there's no need for either of us to change the scope or the estimate (I won't ).
4. Once we agree on a price, I'll start working on it within the schedule we agree on.
5. Personally, I don't like surprises when working with contractors, so I like to give frequent updates on where I'm at: how much time I've spent on things as well as an approximate percentage complete. If it works for you, I would provide this every time I work on your project.

6. If we get to about 90% complete but we've used more than 90% of the budget, I like to know what your expectations are and how you feel things have gone. Sometimes, complications have arisen outside of either of our foresight and things just took longer than expected. And, when that happens, sometimes you just don't have the space in your budget to accomodate the extra cost. _That's okay._ Obviously, I do my best to quote accurately, but no one can see the future. If you do have the space in your budget to accomodate the extra cost, know that I have done everything I can to come in under budget and get the feature/solution done cheaper than we initially agreed.
> We just need to be honest with each other about where I'm at with the project and where you're at financially.
7. Once I believe that I'm done, I'll make sure the code is solidly in your hands and control and will be very specific, "Ok, I think I'm done with xyz. Please take a look and let me know if you agree." I will wait back to hear that we're done and that everything works or is as you hoped it would be.

## The Expectations

- Be honest with me
- Changes or additions after we've started will usually mean a higher end price than we initially discussed
- Unclear requirements will also usually mean a higher end price than we initially discussed
- I typically send invoices at the beginning of a month for the work that was completed in the previous month.
- My default terms of payment is 15 days.

## Wrapping Up

I sincerely hope that this document is helpful to you as we work together.
